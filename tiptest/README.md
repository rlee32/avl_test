The purpose of these tests is to observe the effect of the tip geometry on 
the induced drag and lift.

plainwing.avl: a rectangular-planform wing with constant AOA.
negtwist.avl: plainwing, but with a tip extension that twists into negative 
  angle.
zerotip.avl: plainwing, but with a tip extension that is at geometric 0 deg 
  angle.

The tip extensions have a significant effect on lift and induced drag. Going 
from AR 3 to 3.5 had a huge effect on lift. negtwist increased lift and reduced 
induced drag.
